Sample map built from [nsh_indoor_outdoor.bag](http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~jizhang03/Datasets/nsh_indoor_outdoor.bag) (opened with [ccViewer](http://www.danielgm.net/cc/))

:white_check_mark: Tested with ROS Indigo and Velodyne VLP16. [(Screencast)](https://youtu.be/o1cLXY-Es54)

How to build with catkin:

```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
$ git clone https://github.com/laboshinl/loam_velodyne.git
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release 
$ source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

Running:
```
roslaunch loam_velodyne loam_velodyne.launch
```

In second terminal play sample velodyne data from [VLP16 rosbag](https://db.tt/t2r39mjZ):
```
rosbag play ~/Downloads/velodyne.bag 
```

Or read from velodyne [VLP16 sample pcap](https://midas3.kitware.com/midas/folder/12979):
```
roslaunch velodyne_pointcloud VLP16_points.launch pcap:="/home/laboshinl/Downloads/velodyne.pcap"
```
